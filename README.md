# SortingAlgorithms

This is the Java implementation for the sorting algorithms: Bubble, Insertion, Shell, Selection, and Merge sort. They are nice to have on hand!

Here is a chart of the performance speeds for all off the algorithms where the X-value represents the number of elements in an array being tested and the Y-value is the avg runtime in milliseconds.

SortingAlgorithm is the interface for all algorithm classes
